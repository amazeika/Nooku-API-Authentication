The project is still in very early alpha and not intended for production use. I would love others to review/contribute to the project.

This plugin and associated component allow access to the nook API to be restricted to authenticated parties only. The package contains the following features:

- Request signing using the OAuth signature method
- Replay attack checking
- View BREAD authorisation 

* Future plans are to add component & view based authorisation

Requests are signed using the following formula:

$query = REQUEST_PARAMS <- sort by key, encode each value using rawurlencode()

$string = HTTP_METHOD.'&'.rawurlencode(URI).'&'.rawurlencode($query);

$token = rawurlencode(base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha1', $string, $secret, true)));

The request must contain the following keys:

api_key -< api key from the DB
api_timestamp <- current timestamp in UTC time (requests are valid for 5 minutes)
api_token <- token constructed above

For more information on OAuth request signing see: http://oauth.net/core/1.0/

The package is currently not installable and must be placed manually.
